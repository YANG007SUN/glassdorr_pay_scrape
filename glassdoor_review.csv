54,Maybe It's Just All of the Locations In My Area...,"Former Employee, more than 3 years",Chef,2022-03-03,"Not horrible for a first job
- Reasonable hours for high school/ college students
- In some cases, if there's enough staffing, hours can be a little more flexible.
- You may even be able to pick up hours at another Panda Express location.

Not the worst starting pay
- I believe this varies by area, but when I first started, my pay was about $4 above the federal minimum wage.

There are opportunities for pay raises
-Taking and passing the ServSafe exam guarantees a pay increase (at least when I worked at Panda Express).
- Sometimes you can switch roles/positions (front of the house to back of the house to cook and vice versa).

The work isn't super intensive
- Cooks and BOH primarily do the majority of the lifting, but it's not a constant lifting job.","I primarily worked at one location, but I noticed most of these same problems the handful of times I volunteered to work at two other nearby locations:

A pretty high turnover rate (at least when I was there)
- During my 3 years working here, I've gone through about 6 or 7 different managers
- There was a period when a staff member would quit about every 2 week
- The work environment wasn't hostile, but it definitely wasn't sunshine and rainbows. While we all clearly signed up for this job none of us wanted to be there and in many cases, it showed.

Not enough (reliable) staffing
- There were multiple occasions when I've had to jump between being the kitchen, drive-thru, front counter, and the back of the house (dishwasher area) all at once because multiple staff members either called out at the last minute or showed up super late and there was no replacement. 
- Multiple people constantly showed up late, called out due to ""emergencies"", or simply didn't show up. Personally, after 3+ warnings, I believe these people should have been fired, but I can understand why the management couldn't fire half of the staff.
- There was a point when we didn't have a manager and the staff members had to divvy up the duties for about a month.

Inconsistent managerial skill levels
- To start off, I want to say that not all of my managers were ""bad"". There were 2 that seemed to garner significant respect from the staff. This cannot be said for the rest.
- Most of the staff (including myself) were young (typically high school/college age). The managers that I believe had the most respect, least pushback from workers, and the most efficiency were the ones that didn't act like everyone's friend. A laid-back manager leads to a laid-back (lazy) staff.
- If I am to be working under someone, I expect them to at least understand how to do the basics of my job. Sometimes sending in a half-trained staff member to take the place of a fully-trained one is more trouble than it's worth. They end up getting in the way or just overall slowing everyone down, especially if said staff member is the manager.","Many problems start at the managerial level. It's their responsibility to ensure their staff arrives on time to complete their work in a safe and efficient manner.  If there are repeat offenders, sufficient actions should be taken in order to correct/eliminate these problems. If one or two staff members are able to repeatedly get away with ""breaking the rules"" the rest of the staff is likely to follow in their footsteps, the entire process starts to break down, and overall, everyone's job becomes more difficult.",2.0

64,Panda Express Review,"Former Employee, more than 3 years",Cook,2022-02-26,"Great pay and some flexibility. The wages increase over time and if you are willing to work and move up to management, they are very open and willing to train you. 

If you are a student who is looking to finish a degree and is willing to work a physically demanding position for a higher base pay than working in fast food, this is a place for you. If you don't mind working in a fast paced environment and have to be meticulous about cleaning, this would be great for you.","Physically demanding. Management tends to pile more work onto workers and expect them to still get out at the same time as they are scheduled. High turnover rate, thus having a short staff at some stores.","Management could learn how to better communicate with their team and how they deliver their message. There is a tendency for managers to talk down on their workers thus killing the morale of the store. There is no need to be called out for doing a task wrong or forgetting about a task, be aware that there are multiple tasks that has to be done so there should be some leniency towards that.",3.0
